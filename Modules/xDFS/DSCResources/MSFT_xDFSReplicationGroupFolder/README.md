# Description

This resource is used to configure DFS Replication Group folders. This is an
optional resource, and only needs to be used if the folder Description,
FilenameToExclude or DirectoryNameToExclude fields need to be set. In most cases
just setting the Folders property in the xDFSReplicationGroup resource will be acceptable.
